## Executive Summary
This report presents the static and behavioral analysis of the suspicious DLL file `ncobjapi.dll`. The file, flagged by 37 out of 70 antivirus engines on VirusTotal, is identified as a 64-bit Portable Executable (PE) with multiple indicators of malicious activity. It exhibits capabilities commonly associated with backdoors or droppers, including encrypted payload handling, dynamic API resolution, anti-analysis techniques, and potential credential theft via LSASS dumping. The malware uses legitimate Windows APIs and obfuscation to evade detection and maintain persistence. Static inspection reveals references to security software processes, cryptographic functions, and WMI components, indicating possible lateral movement or surveillance functionalities. Although not packed, the file is engineered to execute malicious code in-memory and is likely part of a larger intrusion framework.

## Capabilities
The file exhibits the following malicious capabilities as identified through analysis:
- Obfuscated stackstrings (anti-analysis/obfuscation)
- Creates new key via CryptAcquireContext (data manipulation/encryption)
- Encrypts or decrypts via WinCrypt (data manipulation/encryption)
- Encrypts data using AES via WinAPI (data manipulation/encryption/AES)
- Contains PDB path (executable/PE/PDB)
- Gets common file path (host interaction/file system)
- Deletes files (host interaction/file system/delete)
- Gets file size (host interaction/file system/meta)
- Moves files (host interaction/file system/move)
- Reads files on Windows (host interaction/file system/read)
- Gets token membership (host interaction/session)
- Creates threads (host interaction/thread/create)
- Links functions at runtime on Windows (linking/runtime-linking)
- Executes shellcode via indirect call (load-code/shellcode)

## Dependencies
The file relies on several Windows DLLs, with functions commonly exploited by malware:

- **KERNEL32.dll Functions and Implications:**
  - `Sleep`: Pauses execution for anti-sandbox or anti-analysis techniques
  - `VirtualProtect`: Changes memory protection to decrypt or execute shellcode
  - `CreateThread`, `GetProcAddress`, `LoadLibraryA`: Dynamically loads and executes malicious code (e.g., DLL injection)
  - `GetModuleFileNameA`, `GetCurrentProcessId`, `GetCurrentThreadId`: Retrieves process/thread info for process hiding or anti-debugging
  - `DeleteFileA`, `ReadFile`, `WriteFile`, `CreateFileA/W`: Direct file manipulation for self-deletion or dropping malicious files
  - `RtlCaptureContext`, `RtlLookupFunctionEntry`, `RtlVirtualUnwind`: Low-level APIs for advanced exception handling or code hiding
  - `UnhandledExceptionFilter`: Hides and triggers payloads through exception handling
  - `HeapSize`, `FlushFileBuffers`: Memory and I/O management to conceal malicious behavior

This behavior aligns with in-memory execution techniques such as reflective DLL loading, consistent with a backdoor or loader.

## Static Analysis

**Top-Level Components:**
- `_RDATA` section: Slightly unusual, possibly a compiler artifact or used for storing shellcode/data stealthily
- All sections show expected permissions and sizes, with no evidence of packing or encryption

**Execution Points of Entry:**

**Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI):**
- Functions like `WmiCommitObject`, `WmiAddObjectProp`, `WmiCreateObject`, etc., suggest potential code injection or data exfiltration via WMI, possibly targeting `wmiprvse.exe`

**Cryptographic APIs:**
- Functions such as `CryptAcquireContextA`, `CryptImportKey`, `CryptDecrypt`, and `CryptSetKeyParam` indicate use for encrypting configuration, payloads, or C2 traffic

**Process & AV-Related Strings:**
- References to antivirus processes like `MsMpEng.exe` (Microsoft Defender), `Mcshield.exe` (McAfee), `TMBMSRV.exe` (Trend Micro), `rtvscan.exe` (Symantec), `ccSetMgr.exe` (Symantec), and `ekrn.exe` (ESET) suggest AV evasion, process injection, or target enumeration

**File Contents:**
- Path linked to LSASS dumping: `C:\Users\123\Desktop\UseWhite\SSPDumpLsass\LoadDumpPass\x64\Release\ncobjapi.pdb`, indicating a component for credential theft

## Conclusion
The DLL `ncobjapi.dll` demonstrates clear traits of a sophisticated malware component. Its use of Windows cryptographic APIs, memory manipulation, exception-based payload delivery, and references to antivirus services strongly suggest its purpose is to evade defenses and operate stealthily within the host system. The presence of WMI-related strings implies an ability to interact with system management features, potentially for reconnaissance or exfiltration. Moreover, the file path linked to LSASS dumping tools signals a high risk of credential theft. Given the evidence, this file should be classified as a high-threat agent, most likely used as a loader or backdoor within a broader attack campaign. Immediate isolation, further behavioral sandboxing, and threat hunting within the network environment are recommended.
